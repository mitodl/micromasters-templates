## Micromasters is a new credential

MIT has created a new credential for online learners: the “MicroMaster’s,” which
will be granted by MITx (MIT’s online learning initiative) to students who do
exceptionally well in a given set of graduate-level online courses and do well
in a subsequent exam. The credential will first be available to students who
register for the [SCM program’s online courses](http://scm.mit.edu/).
